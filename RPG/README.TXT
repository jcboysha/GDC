This is generic comment. If you're reading this you have way too much
time on your hands and way too little faith that the developers left
the default readme comment at the top of a BlueJ generic readme file. 
It's perfectly understandable since you're the 1/1*10e56 people who 
actually read README files though. Enjoy the rest of this readme file.
